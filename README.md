## Face detection and Face Recognition using haarcascade 

a Face Recognition Project using RetinaFace with both face detection and recognition capabilities. I'll guide you through the structure of the project and provide sample .cpp files for both detection and recognition. For this, we'll be utilizing the RetinaFace model for face detection and FaceNet or OpenFace for face recognition.

Before starting, ensure you have the following dependencies:

OpenCV for handling image operations.

RetinaFace for face detection.

FaceNet or OpenFace for face recognition.

CMake and Make tools to compile the project.
